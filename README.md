## Installation

To get started with tlsferret, you can download the latest release from our [Releases section](https://github.com/Yannvvv/tlsferret/releases). Make sure to download the appropriate file for your operating system and execute it as per the instructions provided.

### Prerequisites

Before installing, ensure you have the following:

- A compatible operating system (Linux, macOS, or Windows).
- Rust installed on your machine (if you want to build from source).

### Building from Source

If you prefer to build tlsferret from source, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yannvvv/tlsferret.git
   cd tlsferret
   ```

2. Build the project:

   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

3. Run the scanner:

   ```bash
   ./target/release/tlsferret <target>
   ```

## Usage

Using tlsferret is straightforward. Once installed, you can run it from the command line.

### Basic Command

To scan a target, simply run:

```bash
tlsferret <target>
```

Replace `<target>` with the domain or IP address you want to scan.

### Options

You can customize your scan with various options:

- `-p, --port <port>`: Specify a port to scan (default is 443).
- `--verbose`: Enable verbose output for detailed information.
- `--output <file>`: Save the scan results to a specified file.

### Example

```bash
tlsferret --verbose --output results.txt example.com
```

This command scans `example.com` and saves the results to `results.txt` while providing detailed output.

## Topics

This repository covers a variety of topics related to SSL/TLS security:

- **Certificate**: Analyze the validity and configuration of SSL/TLS certificates.
- **Cipher**: Assess the strength of cipher suites in use.
